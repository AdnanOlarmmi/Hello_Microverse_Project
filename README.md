# Hello_Microverse

![](./hello.png)

In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. 
The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps.
I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Additional Tools

- WebHint
- Stylelint
- Node Packet Manager

### Prerequisites

- Basic html, css and medium Javascript know how.
- Git installation
- A text editor 
- A terminal
- A web browser to view output
- An IDE e.g Visual studio code

### Run Tests
To track linter errors locally follow these steps:  

Download all the dependencies run:
```
npm install
```
Track HTML linter errors run:
```
npx hint .
```
Track CSS linter errors run:
